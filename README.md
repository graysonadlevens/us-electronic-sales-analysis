# 2019 U.S. Electronics Sales Analysis (Public Dataset)

## Overview
This project analyzes a publicly available 2019 U.S. electronics sales dataset to identify revenue trends, top-performing products, and seasonal patterns.
The goal is to demonstrate SQL-based data analysis and business intelligence reporting through a realistic business use case.


## Business Questions
- How does revenue change month over month throughout 2019?
- Which products generate the highest total revenue?
- Are there clear seasonal trends that could impact inventory planning?

## Tools & Skills Used
- **PostgreSQL**: SQL querying, aggregation, date filtering
- **Power BI**: Power Query transformations, data modeling, dashboard creation
- **Business Analytics**: revenue analysis, trend identification, executive reporting

## Business Insights

**Revenue Trends**
- Revenue increased steadily throughout the year, with a pronounced spike in Q4, indicating strong seasonality likely driven by holiday demand.

**Top Products**
- A small group of high-priced products generates a disproportionately large share of total revenue, highlighting revenue concentration and margin optimization opportunities.

**Operational Implications**
- Seasonal demand patterns suggest the need for inventory ramp-up ahead of Q4.
- Prioritizing forecasting and inventory planning for top revenue-driving products could improve service levels and reduce stockouts.
